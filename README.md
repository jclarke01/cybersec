This script is a basic keylogger implemented in Python using the pynput library to capture keyboard inputs. 
The logged keystrokes are then color-coded based on predefined keywords.
The script periodically sends the collected keyboard data to a specified server using HTTP POST requests. 
It utilizes threading to schedule the sending of data at regular intervals.

Here's a summary of the key components:

Keylogging Logic:

Uses the pynput library to capture keyboard inputs.
Maps certain keys to specific actions, such as handling special keys like Enter, Tab, Space, Backspace, and Ctrl.
Stores the pressed keys in the text variable.
Color Coding:

Defines color codes using ANSI escape codes for specific keywords (e.g., Gmail, Facebook, Bank) to visually distinguish them in the output.
HTTP POST Requests:

Sends the collected keyboard data as a JSON payload to a specified server at regular intervals (controlled by time_interval).
Uses the requests library to make HTTP POST requests.
Error Handling:

Catches exceptions during the POST request process and prints an error message if the request couldn't be completed.
Termination:

Allows the user to terminate the keylogger by pressing the 'Esc' key.
