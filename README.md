The Python program serves as a password strength checker, providing users with a tool to assess the security level of their passwords. It incorporates functions to detect common passwords, evaluate strength based on various criteria, and interactively prompt users for password input.

Key Components: 

Constants:
The program includes a list of COMMON_PASSWORDS to identify commonly used passwords.

Functions:
is_common_password(password): Checks if the given password is among common choices.
check_password_strength(password): Assesses password strength considering length, common patterns, and character classes.
ask_pwd(another_pwd=False): Prompts users to enter another password or check the strength, ensuring interactive user engagement.

Execution Flow:
The program begins with a welcome message and the option to check password strength or exit.
User input is secured with getpass.getpass() for password entry.
Password strength is evaluated, and the program provides feedback on the strength level and a hint based on the assessment.
Users can opt to enter another password or exit the program.

Strength Levels:
Passwords are categorized into strength levels 1 to 5, with corresponding remarks indicating the password's strength.
Strength levels are determined by factors such as common patterns, length, and character classes.

User Interaction:
The program maintains interactive communication with users through input prompts, ensuring clarity and user-friendly operation.

Execution Condition:
The main execution section ensures the program runs when executed directly.
